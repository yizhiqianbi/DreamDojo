# 💭 DreamDojo

## 🔥 Highlights

*DreamDojo* is an interactive world model that learns from large-scale human videos. In short, we made the following key contributions:

- **A large-scale video dataset.** 44k hours of diverse human egocentric videos, the largest dataset to date for world model pretraining.
- **A foundation world model.** The first robot world model of its kind that demonstrates strong generalization to diverse objects and environments after post-training.
- **A distillation pipeline.** After distillation, our model can achieve long-horizon autoregressive generation, with stable real-time interactions at 10 FPS for over 1 minute.

## 📢 News

- **[2026/02/18]** We released both pretraining and post-training code.
- **[2026/02/18]** We released all pretrained and post-trained checkpoints (2B and 14B).
- **[2026/02/18]** We released the GR-1 post-training datasets and the evaluation sets.
- **[2026/02/09]** We released our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06949) on arXiv.

## Jokeru Parallel-World Lab

This fork adds an end-to-end mock VLA/world-model loop on the downloaded Jokeru datasets:

```text
recorded Jokeru observation
        ↓
π0.5 (8 independent flow-matching samples, 48 × 30D each)
        ↓
Jokeru action projector (48 × 384D each)
        ↓
DreamDojo (4 chained 12-action windows per branch)
        ↓
8 generated 49-frame parallel futures
```

The current long-path artifact follows five consecutive 48-step stages. Each stage contains seven sampled π0.5/DreamDojo futures and one hidden recorded GT future; after all eight play, the GT branch is revealed and its endpoint becomes the next observation. The resulting 240-step path and reproducible 46.5-second 1080p edit are included in the repository. The [web viewer](https://dreamdojo-jokeru-lab.boingshaw.chatgpt.site) opens with this five-layer showcase, then renders the original one-stage graph on a pannable and zoomable canvas.

The official DreamDojo Self-Forcing pipeline is also adapted to Jokeru's 384D action conditioning. It includes teacher-trajectory caching, causal warmup, Self-Forcing DMD training, readiness checks, and 4-step compiled student inference. NVIDIA does not publish a Jokeru-specific distilled student checkpoint, so the current videos are explicitly teacher outputs; accelerated-student performance is reported only after those training stages produce a checkpoint.
